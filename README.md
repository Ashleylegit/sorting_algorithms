Project Objectives<br><br>

This repository intends to demonstrate an understanding of the C programming language covering sorting algorithms and the following concepts:<br>
* Explain the different types of sorting algorithms<br>
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm<br>
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input<br>
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
